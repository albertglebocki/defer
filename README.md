The following is a simple implementation of a defer mechanism in C, allowing automatic code execution
at the end of a defined scope. This helps with resources management, and prevents memory related issues.

To see the example usage, please refer to `example.c` file in this repository.

To use the library in your codebase just include the `defer.h` header.
